Q: A bag contains 3 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. Then, 2  marbles are drawn from the bag, at random, without replacement.
If the first marble drawn is red, what is the probability that the second marble is blue?


After drawing the first marble, we are left with 2 red marbles and 4 blue marbles. 
Now we calculate the probability of drawing a blue marble as :

= (# of blue marbles) / (total # of marbles)
= 4 / (2 + 4)
= 2 / 3

Answer: 2/3
