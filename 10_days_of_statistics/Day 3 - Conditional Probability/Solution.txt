There are 4 possible scenarios: (B, B), (B, G), (G, B), (G, G)

We know that 1 child is a boy, so now we have 3 scenarios: (B, B), (B, G), (G, B)

When asked, "what is the probability that both children are boys", the only scenario that 
matches this is: (B, B). So (B,B)/all possibilities (3) = 1/3.



Answer: 1/3
